# Momentum

## About

Momentum, a Medium clone, is a website where users can share travel destinations, recommendations, interact with other travelers' posts.
Users can share stories of their travels with a picture and a brief description of their experience.
If a user enjoys another user's story they can leave a like and/or comment on the user's post.
Then if a user really likes the stories another user is sharing, they can follow that user.
